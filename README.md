This is a small web application that you can use to control an instance of mplayer running in slave mode.

Also included is a script that can populate a mysql database with mp3 files, and a sample database structure.

The webserver should have mysqld, memcached and php with memcache support.

The python script for populating the database uses PyExifTool (http://smarnach.github.com/pyexiftool/).
